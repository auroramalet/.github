# Auroramålet

#### Aurora is a growing group of children, young people and adults who are preparing a court case against the Swedish state for their lack of climate action. Everyone, regardless of age, who wants to be involved and stand up for our rights is welcome to contribute!

Today, Swedish climate measures are far from sufficient to reduce the threats from climate change. These threats will mostly affect younger and future generations.

The government has set climate targets that exclude the majority of our emissions and that are also far from ambitious enough for Sweden to do its fair share of global emissions reductions. And the inadequate climate targets are not even being met. With the state's current climate efforts, we in Sweden face major climatological threats in the form of extreme weather, drought, forest fires and increases in infections carried by ticks, mosquitoes, rodents, food and water, among other things. The mental health of young people is also affected by the climate crisis.  Aurora believes that for us children and young people, the right to life, health and development guaranteed to us by the European Convention, the Constitution and the Convention on the Rights of the Child is at risk.
